Nano Plan

- UI Bonus: get the faves sticker working using jquery
- UI Bonus: try out a background watermark with the current tab name
- UI: Conversation aligned to appropriate tweet, if smaller than window, then overlay
- UI: popovers and dialogs are modal
- UI: Transition effect when switching tabs (mentions, private, etc.)
- Basic functionality milestone:
  - ajax polling receives new tweets
  - post new tweets, replies
  - favoriting
  - 
  
Future feature ideas:
  - Replies to this tweet/conv (Tweetie only finds history)
  - Replacement for twitlonger with our own service
  - URL shortening (via another service?)
  -
